I teach and/or contribute to a variety of courses at Goldsmiths, University of London, at St Mary's University in Twickenham, and in the context of the UWC movement. Here I only list the courses for which I can publicly share teaching materials.

## Core Quantitative Research Methods

A 15-week course for PhD and MPhil students at Goldsmiths that explores quantitative research designs and core statistical concepts, while introducing the students to R and the tidyverse for data analysis and visualisation. It is taught based on a flipped classroom format. Check out:

- the [Module Notes](https://lukaswallrich.github.io/GoldCoreQuants/) that particularly focus on the use of R
- the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ZugACAXuZMCZd_Mb70obw) that contains lectures for all elements of the module

## Introduction to Social Psychology

This 5-week first-year module was taught using a flipped classroom approach in 2020-21 due to the Covid-pandemic. The lectures with interactive preparation tasks and some further materials can be found on the [module webpage](https://lukaswallrich.github.io/StMarysSocPsy/), powered by Github Pages.
