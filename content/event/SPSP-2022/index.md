abstract: A wealth of research has revealed pervasive biases when it comes to ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, weight, disability and so on. However, there is little comparative research that could enable us to understand commonalities and differences across these patterns. In addition, while we all know that social change is occuring, there is little evidence regarding its reach and speed. The wealth of Project Implicit data allows one to assess the prevalence and trajectory of biases - this presentation shows preliminary results from a project in which we aim to harvest that data. Comments welcome.
