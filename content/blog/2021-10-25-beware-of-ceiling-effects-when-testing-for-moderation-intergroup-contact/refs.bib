	abstract = {In two Flemish samples (N=215 and N=90) two competing hypotheses concerning the simultaneous effects of intergroup contact and authoritarianism on prejudice were tested. While it has been suggested that authoritarianism may hinder the reduction of prejudice through intergroup contact, it has also been proposed that intergroup contact can be especially effective among high scorers on right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). The present results supported the latter hypothesis. Moreover, high scorers on RWA and SDO exhibited lower levels of prejudice when having more positive contact, as well as exacerbated levels of prejudice when having more negative contact. The discussion focuses on some possible mechanisms that may underlie the reduction of prejudice among high-scoring authoritarians.},

Study 1 was correlational, while in Study 2 we measured SDO and experimentally manipulated intergroup contact (imagined contact paradigm). We found that SDO and intergroup contact interacted on support for multiculturalism: Intergroup contact was associated with more support for multiculturalism only for high-SDO individuals, and SDO was negatively associated to support for multiculturalism more strongly for individuals with low or no contact. Finally, we discussed the role of the intergroup setting in which studies are conducted.},

	abstract = {Five studies tested whether intergroup contact reduces negative outgroup attitudes through a process of ingroup distancing. Based on the deprovincialization hypothesis and Social Dominance Theory, we hypothesized that the indirect effect of cross-group friendship on outgroup attitudes via reduced ingroup identification is moderated by individuals’ Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), and occurs only for members of high status majority groups. We tested these predictions in three different intergroup contexts, involving conflictual relations between social groups in Germany (Study 1; N = 150; longitudinal Study 2: N = 753), Northern Ireland (Study 3: N = 160; Study 4: N = 1,948), and England (Study 5; N = 594). Cross-group friendship was associated with reduced ingroup identification and the link between reduced ingroup identification and improved outgroup attitudes was moderated by SDO (the indirect effect of cross-group friendship on outgroup attitudes via reduced ingroup only occurred for individuals scoring high, but not low, in SDO). Although there was a consistent moderating effect of SDO in high-status majority groups (Studies 1–5), but not low-status minority groups (Studies 3, 4, and 5), the interaction by SDO was not reliably stronger in high- than low-status groups. Findings are discussed in terms of better understanding deprovincialization effects of contact.},

	abstract = {Psychological theories often invoke interactions but remain vague regarding the details. As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},
