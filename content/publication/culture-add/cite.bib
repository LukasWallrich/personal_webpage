  abstract = {Many organisations are striving to diversify their workforces, hoping to counter inequality while boosting team performance. Assessment tools and processes have been adapted to reduce the impact of bias, yet to realise the benefits of diversity, more is needed. The hiring paradigm needs to shift from assessing competence and culture fit to assessing each candidate’s unique contribution to an organisation and team – i.e. their culture add. While this idea has gained some currency in recent years, it has far-reaching implications for assessment and recruiting that are discussed here – a key implication being that no (individual-level) test can exist to assess culture add and rank candidates accordingly, so that assessment needs to be approached more broadly. This needs to be considered alongside the current rise of algorithmic selection tools, and occupational psychologists are called on to play an active part in ensuring that greater diversity comes about and that its potential benefits are realised.  },
