abstract: In psychological science, replicability — repeating a study with a new sample achieving
consistent results (Parsons et al., 2022) — is critical for affirming the validity of
scientific findings. Despite its importance, replication efforts are few and far between
in psychological science with many attempts failing to corroborate past findings.
This scarcity, compounded by the difficulty in accessing replication data, jeopardizes
the efficient allocation of research resources and impedes scientific advancement.
Addressing this crucial gap, we present the Replication Database (https://forrt-
replications.shinyapps.io/fred_explorer), a novel platform hosting 1,239 original
findings paired with replication findings. The infrastructure of this database allows
researchers to submit, access, and engage with replication findings. The database
makes replications visible, easily findable via a graphical user interface, and tracks
replication rates across various factors, such as publication year or journal. This will
facilitate future efforts to evaluate the robustness of psychological research.

summary: The replicability of psychological science has been widely discussed since the Reproducibility Project back in 2015. This paper introduces the Replication Database, a platform that hosts 1,239 original findings paired with replication findings. In addition to supporting research on replicability in general, this dynamic database is intended to make it easier to find replications of specific studies, and thus base teaching and research on more robust evidence.
