There are several places on this website that requires you to identify yourself:


# Google Analytics

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects *non-personally identifiable* information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times and referring website address. This information is presented to me as aggregated reports.

# Social sharing

If you are using the social sharing buttons (e.g., for Twitter) on my website then the privacy policy of those websites apply.

Please contact me with any questions.
