I am working as a Lecturer in the [Department of Organisational Psychology](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/departments/orgpsych/) at Birkbeck, University of London. There, I teach on organisational psychology master programmes and primarily research how workforce diversity can be harnessed to improve organisational performance. Other research interests include the effect of intergroup contact on pro-social behaviour, the development of stereotypes and implicit associations and the influence of traditional and new media on public attitudes.  


I recently wrapped up my PhD at [Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.gold.ac.uk). In that research, I focused on the relationships between intergroup contact and diversity beliefs. I am a member of the [Equalab](http://equalab.co.uk/) and former member of the [DIPlab](http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/diplab/) research groups.
