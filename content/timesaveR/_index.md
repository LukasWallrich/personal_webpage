As a powerful Open Source statistical software, *R* has the potential to make research more efficient and transparent ... yet particularly with regard to efficiency, it does not always deliver, as I had to learn the hard way.

To allow others to move faster from data to insights and publication-ready tables, I created an R package that includes functions that have saved me a lot of time over the years. **Have a look at my [Getting Started article](https://lukaswallrich.github.io/timesaveR/articles/getting_started.html)** and try it out - it is in its early stages, so I welcome any feedback, contributions and feature requests.
